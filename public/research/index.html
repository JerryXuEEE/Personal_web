<h3 id="Ach1">The Neural Asymmetry Deviations Between Guitarists and Pianists <em> OHBM (Organization of Human Brain Mapping)</em></h3>
<p>
This abstract was accepted in 2021.12.15. Unfortunately, the conference was held in Glasgow in 2022.7, which I was not able to attend due to the pandamic. Anyway, I uploaded a 5 minustes video recording the oral  report about my research.</p>
<p>
THis research is the "predecessor" of my journal article. It is about the neural asymmetry of pianists and guitarists. We recruited 10 guitarists, 10 pianists and 10 nonmusicians and collected their EEG signals when performing a Hand Coordination Paradigm, a Bimual Pressing Task paradigm and a N-back Paradigm. 
</p>
<p>
As I'm mainly intersted in the asymmetry, besides power spectrum, I did the Source Localization and functionaly connectivity and found that significant discrepancy could be obeserved in the frontal-parietal region.

<h3 id="Ach2">Different Music Training Modulates Theta Oscillation Associated with Executive Control<em>Brain Sciences</em></h3>
<p>
This article was submitted to <em>Brain Sciences</em> in 2022.8. 
</p>  
<p>
As a fan of guitar, I've been curious about the different changes that different music instruments could bring to our brain. As I reviewed more and more literature about this topic, I began to realise the difference should be related to the higher order brain plasticity instead of only structural neural asymmetry. Therefore, I have shifted my focus from asymmetry to the executive control, which discribes the ability that our brain instructs the motion and some other elements.Then, we continously recuited 20 string musicians, 20 pianists and 20 non-musicians to conduct a Hand Coordination Paradigm, a Bimual Pressing Task paradigm and a N-back Paradigm while collecting their neural activity by EEG.  
</p>
<p>
In the data anlysis, we tried multiple ways such as ERP, time-frequency analysis, and functional connectivity. In ERP anlysis, we found that pianists have significantly earlier and lower P2 components. This result was supported by many other researches about executive function comparison. Then in time-frequency analysis, we found that pianists outperformed string musicians in theta power in 500-800ms after the stimulus. This implies that the pianists have greater theta activity. It could result from their bimanual training scheme, which requires much more focus and correlation. These are all fundamental elements in executive control. Therefore, we believe that different music training could relate to executive function in theta oscillation to different content. This is futher verified by functional connectivity, in which we applied executive control model and found that the frontal-parietal connectivity has been greatly enhanced in the pianists. We also found asymmetric connectivity.

The measurements reflect the mean theta (4-7 Hz) power between 500 and 800 post-stimulus from C3. (B) Group mean difference in theta power between three groups (string musicians showed as String in the figure, pianists showed as Piano in the figure, the control group showed as Control in the figure). The measurements reflect the mean theta (4-7 Hz) power between 500 and 800 post-stimulus from C4.

<p>
This abstract reports the theta oscillation we found on musicians compared with nonmusicians. It was submitted and accepted by the conference at 2022.7. Finally, I will be presenting this report at the Henan Normal University in 2022,11,25. Afterwards, the abstract will be published on the cnki.net.

<h2 id="Interests">Interests in Neuroscience </h2>
<p>
Three years of research experience in the <em>Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation of Medical Education</em> 
have equipped me with rigorous experimental thinking, research reviewing skills, and cooperative interdiscipline mind.
I'm also a quick learner. I spent one month on the EEG data processing tools with the help of my senior, Dr Long.
In everday life, I enjoy quietly doiing my own stuff from day to night. I always find peace and fulfillment in such a quiet time.
I'm fully aware of the process and hardship of scientific research, more specifically, of publishing a journal article. 
Still, I constantly find myself immersed in the process of learning new things, the amazement at novel discovery, and 
the sense of achievement of making progress in scientific research. 
</p>
<p>
I'm really intersted in the neuroscience not only because I like the myterious part of such a charming organ, but also due to my day dream of astonished discovery that blazes a brandnew world. In my following research, I'm intersted in the computational neuroscience as I'm a science student. Neuroscience is an interdiscpline subject. I want to take the advantage of my research background on cognitive neuroscience and EE major, and devote into applying computer technology to discover more intersting facts about the brain.
