<h3 >Brief Introduction of Related Courses</h3>    
<h4 id="Related1">Engineering English</h4>
<p>This course aims to improve essential <strong>academic English skills</strong>, including presentation, reading, and writing.
During this course, I was the TA and was commended by both foreign and UESTC teachers.
In this course, we had many reports to write to promote academic paper writing and many presentations to give to enhance conference presentation skills.</p>
<h4 id="Related2">Team Design Project Skills(TDPS)</h4>
<p>This is a challenging and fun course that will be introduced explicitly in <span href="#TDPS">the following article</span>. 
Generally, we (a team of 10 Students) were required to design a <strong>robotic rover</strong> to complete a series of tasks, including line tracking, shape recognization, and placing a tennis ball. 
In this process, I'm mainly responsible for the shape recognition module and <strong>machine vision</strong>, developed by Micro Python for OpenMV.</p> 
<h4 id="Related3">Overall Introduction of Elective Cirriculum </h4>    
<p>I attended a series of courses about <strong>neuroscience</strong> (8 in total) in years two and three. </p>
<p>These courses include <em>anatomical and cognitive theories</em>, <em>EG and MRI</em>, and <em>data analysis</em>. I'm currently studying a course about computational neuroscience and neural data analysis.
In these courses, we also have to complete a series of laboratory experiments, such as EEG Gonogo, MRI static data acquisition, and even inserting invasive electrodes on mice.</p>
<p>The teachers come from different fields, including EEG, MRI, Anatomy, or Neuron, and have diverse backgrounds such as cs, physics, or psychology.
Generally, these courses combine scientific research and basic theory to construct a basic understanding of neuroscience. </p>

<h3 id="Scientific">Scientific Research Skills</h3>
<p>
    Three years of research experience in the <em>Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation of Medical Education</em> 
    have equipped me with rigorous experimental thinking, research reviewing skills, and a cooperative interdisciplinary mind.
    <strong>I'm fully aware of the process and hardship of scientific research, more specifically, of publishing a journal article</strong>. 
    Still, I constantly find myself immersed in the process of learning new things, the amazement at novel discovery, and 
    the sense of achievement in making progress in scientific research.

<h2 id="TDPS">Team Design Project Skills(TDPS)</h2> 
<p>
    This course is about building an intelligent robotic rover by a team of ten students. This rover needs to complete a couple of tasks on two patios. 
    In patio one, it has to follow the line, cross a bridge and stop exactly at the end.
    In patio two, it has to recognize the shape of a triangle, square, and circle, follow the route according to this shape, place a tennis ball in a basket, 
    and transmit a signal to the computer at the end.   
</p> 
<p>The video below shows the final demonstration of our rover.</p>

    The images below show the appearance of our rover during the shape recognition process and part of the project code.

<p>
In this course, I'm mainly in charge of shape recognition and machine vision. In our rover, we decided to apply the OpenMV due to convenience and portability. 
The camera, OpenMV, was connected to the main board. As long as it detects the target and successfully recognizes its shape, 
it returns a value representing its shape to the main board through UART.</p>
<p>This recognition module was developed by <strong>MicroPython</strong> and contained mainly four parts: preprocessing, filtering, detection and recognition, and average and communication.
This module was developed and tested all by myself, in which I encountered a lot of obstacles such as overflow, interference, and connection issues.
Overall, I was so delighted that this module successfully worked in the final demo.
