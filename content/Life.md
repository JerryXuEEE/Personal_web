<h2 id="Music">Music-Guitar</h2> 
<p>
When I was about 9, I was playing with a toy when I suddenly pictured myself playing the electric guitar on the stage with a wild posture. Since then, I've been learning guitar, <strong>a 13-year guitar journey</strong>. I knew the classical guitar for 4 years and the acoustic guitar for 3 years. Due to stressful schoolwork, I quit for a year.</p>
<p>Then in senior high school, I picked it up under the influence of my dear friend, <span id="#GuitarFriend">Haoyang Chen<span>, who taught me about the <strong>Fingerstyle Guitar</strong>, a type of solo guitar combinig cords and melody. Then my genuine passion for guitar eventually went off. I began to learn about  <a href="https://twitter.com/tommyemmanuel" alt="Tommy Emnanuel"title="Link to Twitter page">Tommy Emmanuel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kotaro_oshio" alt="Kotaro Oshio"title="Link to Twitter page">Kotaro Oshio</a>. These real guitar masters showed me the emotion conveyed through every single note under a touch on the string. </p>

<center><div style=" color: gray; font_size: 75%">A Guitar Performance</div></center>
<p>In college, I learned about <strong>Jazz Music</strong>, again under the influence of Chen. I learned about the conflicting and compromising in music and the novelty of improvising Jazz. Therefore, I began to read books about Music Theory and Composing instead of Physics in the library. I'm especially fond of two young and talented guitar musicians, <a href="https://twitter.com/gogosatoshi?lang=en" alt="Satoshi Gogo"title="Link to Twitter page">Satoshi Gogo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/igusaseiji" alt="Seiji Igusa"title="Link to Twitter page">Seiji Igusa</a>. Their albums are my favorite, particularly those published in the last decade.</p>
<p>Although I am a guitar fan, I'm a rebel in my heart, deeply impressed by the piano, the king of the instrument. Destiny allowed me to take a walk with a girl from the Sichuan Conservatory of Music, who is now my beloved girlfriend. A "custodian" on my road towards the palace of the music. I now picture myself as an older man, playing the guitar, playing the Jazz with some odd chords on a sofa beside a bonfire.

<h2 id="Sports">Sports-Basketball</h2>
<p>
Under my dad's influence, I always feel relief about exercise. Thirty minutes running along the river near my neighborhood was my nostalgia for my childhood. Since year three of junior high, I began to play basketball as I found it fun to make cool and crazy moves. Although I might not be good at it, I felt complacent when I made those exaggerated headfakes.</p> 
<p>Later, I wanted to impress my classmates with advanced basketball skills in senior high. I remember that whole summer when every night was my specialized training,  including 10 minutes dribbling, 20 minutes spot shooting, and 20 minutes jump shot. I'm still amazed at this motivated boy with the enthusiasm and persistence I now particularly desire. </p>

    <center><div style=" color: gray; font_size: 75%">Basketball Team in College</div></center>
<p>In college, I joined the basketball team and found a place on the basketball field. However, later I left as I thought I was not treated with respect. Till now, basketball is still an entertaining activity for me as it involves teamwork, and I have a great time with my friend. As I grew up, I gradually gained a realistic idea about basketball, that this is just a way to relax, which is merely an aid to the main course.</p>


<h2 id="School">School Life</h2> 
<p>
My school life is colorful and fulfilled. In college, I have a couple of nice friends from my high school, class, club and "HotPot".
</p>
<h3 id="High School">High School Friends</h3>
<p>
Due to many treatured memories in high school, we, five boys separated all around China, are still in good touch. In year one in college, we hung out even twice a week to play basketball "thanks" to the covid. They are my very close friends that share no secrets. They've been my listeners to thought and been supporting my life's plan. This god-given friendship has been my most valuable treature of my life.

<h3 id="Class Friends">College Class Friends</h3>
<p>
Two of my class friends, Ben and Russel, have brought me much fun as their company in many classes. Most of the time, we do the class project and curriculum experiments and study for tests with each other. We sometimes even argue with each other as we have different research interests. Ben is interested in finance and is now committed to Peking University for a master's. Russel is interested in deep learning and has a very high GPA. Both positively influenced my college study, which I'm forever grateful for.

<h3 id="Club">Club</h3>
<p>
In college, I joined our school's music club, named Ginkgo Music. It is a massive club consisting of seven sub-clubs, including guitar, piano, vocal music, electric music, rap, cooking, and harmonica. We hold performances about once a month and some great activities in school twice a semester. </p>

<p>In this club, I made adorable friends who were even invited to my home. They have brought a lot of fun to my college life out of class. Without them, my college life would be tedious study and countless tests. They are part of the reason for my colorful college life.

<h3 id="HotPot">HotPot Friends</h3>
<p>
As a Chengduer, I'm so obsessed with HotPot, and so are my friends. They are my previous high school classmates, as I transferred class once in high school. One of them is the respectful guitar enlightener I mentioned in part about <a href="#GuitarFriend">my Guitar</a>. After graduation, we play the Rainbow Six from time to time. One common hobby we share is the obsession with HotPot that united us once a semester. We even call each other inmates as if we were in some "Drug Treatment Center".
