My name is Jerry Xu (Ruijie Xu). I'm a year four <strong>undergraduate student</strong> from <em>UESTC</em> (University of Electric Science and Technology of China). I'm applying for <strong>PhD position</strong> 2023 Fall in computational neuroscience. I'm majoring in <strong>EE</strong>, and I've been working with my advisor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OLWmCDYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra">Jing Lu</a> in the team of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ClUoWqsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Yao</a> in the <https://www.neuro.uestc.edu.cn/en/"><em> Key Laboratory for Neuroinformation of Medical Education </em></a> for more than two years.
As the first author, I have published a journal article in <strong>Brain Sciences</strong> and two conference paper at <strong>OHBM</strong>(Organization of Human Brain Mapping) and <strong>National Academic Conference of Psychology</strong>. On November 25, I'm about to present a report at the National Academic Conference of Psychology at the Henan Normal University.

<p>
As for <a href="/./Curriculum/" title="Grades and Cuuriculum Introduction">curriculum</a> (<strong>GPA 3.78</strong>), besides EE courses, I have attended many elective courses about neuroscience. Three years of college life and research experience have equipped me with critical thinking, research reviewing skills, and a collective interdisciplinary mind. I am also a quick leaner interseted in research of novelty.
</p> 
<p>
I am greatly intersted in scientific research targeted at brain technology, believing that this is the future of the human race. 
This is an arcane and grandeur field to devote to.
